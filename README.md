Students who want to learn Python with Django.

## How to use this Project

Students can visit the code sections topicwise by which they can 
Learn the langauge step by step and this will help them to
revise the already learnt topics as well.
And then practice the questions related to that topic, which are given in
the Question Bank Pdf in this repository.
